Since Idaho's population (the number of pigeons in this case) is greater than 1168128, there must be at least two people who share all of the mentioned traits."

Extending this guarantees that there must be at least one hole with at least $n$ pigeons given that $(n-1)*h < p$ for some positive integer $n$, some number of holes $h$, and some number of pigeons $p$.

It may also be effective when trying to argue that something is either impossible or guaranteed.\n",

On the other hand, since it does not test for more than it guarantees, one can apply the *Pigeonhole Principle* as a preliminary test to a large variety of problems.
